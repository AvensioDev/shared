# Contributing to @avensio/shared

Thanks for helping improve the shared data-structure toolkit! This document explains how to get started, what quality gates we expect, and how releases are coordinated.

## Project layout

- **Source** lives under `src/` (lists, queues, heaps, etc.)
- **Tests** live under `test/` (Vitest) with micro-benchmarks under `test/benchmarks/`
- **Docs** live under `docs/` and are rendered via VitePress
- **Tooling** scripts live in `scripts/` (including git hooks)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and pnpm 10.20+
- Run `pnpm install` from the repo root (monorepo) so shared tooling is linked

## Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`.
2. **Develop with safety nets**:
   - `pnpm dev` for watch mode with coverage
   - `pnpm test` for the full Vitest suite
   - `pnpm bench` for micro-benchmarks when touching performance-sensitive paths
3. **Update docs** alongside code:
   - Page content in `docs/*.md`
   - API reference via `pnpm docs:api`
4. **Validate the docs site**: `pnpm docs:dev` and `pnpm docs:build && pnpm docs:preview`
5. **Commit and create PR**; `scripts/hooks/commit-msg.mjs` enforces commitlint with tags given in `changelog.config.ts`

Before pushing, run:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused; separate refactors from features/fixes.
- Add tests for regressions or new behavior.
- Update docs and changelog entries when user-facing changes occur.
- Reference related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## Release process

Releases are handled via the `pnpm release` script, which runs tests, builds, generates docs, and updates the changelog. The [mono-repo](https://github.com/AvensioDev/avensio) contains CI workflows that publish documentation and packages once changes land on `main`.

If you need to cut a release manually:

```bash
pnpm release
# follow the prompts and push the resulting tag
```

## Reporting bugs & requesting features

Use the GitHub issue templates (`Bug report` / `Feature request`). Provide reproducible steps, environment details, and failing tests where possible.
